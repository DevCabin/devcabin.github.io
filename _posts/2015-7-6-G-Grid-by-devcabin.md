title: Yet another responsive grid. Here's why I did it (and where you can get it).

I'll be honest, I know the world doesn't need another responsive grid. I get that. But I use Bootstrap to make custom web site designs responsive, and there is just too many wasted KB in there. 

If you have a workflow similar to mine, you may find it useful. At the time of this post, I haven't actually used it in the real world. Don't worry, I will be, and I'll be posting what I create for free over at goods.devcabin.com. 

Bootstrap is great for back end devs and one page app devs who need a functional front-end without blowing their budget on design. I get that. I mean, we see it everywhere. And it works. 

But if you are a front end guy who is tasked with coding complex PSD web layouts, and you need a 12 column grid to make your life easier, without styles for buttons, tables, navigation, etc ... why not try it out?

And in case you didn't read it already, this thing is in a pre 1.0 state. We're talking alpha testing here. Not beta. I'm a long way from version 2.0. So if you're bored and / or looking for something  better / different ... try it! Then email me your feedback.
