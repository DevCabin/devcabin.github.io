Well that was fast...

This was a rather ambitious project for someone with so little time to try to perfect. I tried it out in two phases after its creation. 

First, I tried to convert a pre made bootstrap layout to use g-grid. Well, lt's just say it didn't work out. It was then I began to realize the full weight of the task. 

Second, I tried to create a SIMPLE template from scratch with my grid. Two divs in I got a taste of how far it has to go if it would ever be a real contender. 

It is with a heavy heart and more experienced brow that I now declare this repo defunct. Stay tuned for a new link.
